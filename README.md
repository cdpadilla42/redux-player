# React / Redux Practice Timer

## Simple practice routine to keep track of practice tasks for musicians

A handy little application to leave running so musicians can check if they've reached their daily practice minutes goals.

This project was taken on to help me get my feet wet with intricate interactions with Redux. The project is set up with an pre-hooks method of incorperating Redux. Actions are hand written, binding state to props is done with the partial application function Connect provided by redux, and the built in setTimeout function is used to dispatch the passage of time to update the Redux store.

Tech used:

- React
- Redux
- HTML/CSS
- Deployed to Netlify
